As of Android Studio 0.5.8, the NDK build process is not mature. Thus, manual efforts are necessary to build and link the native interface to the core library.
Note that the airbitz build.gradle file turns off automatic ndk building so these manual techniques are not overwritten.

Here is the basic procedure:

1) Obtain the core library .so file and the ABC.h file
2) Create an ABC.i file for swig. It just references the ABC.h file
3) build the bridge JNI using swig in a terminal
4) Perform ndk-build in a terminal at the jni directory (note at this time tempEventA and tempEventB are not in the core .so file, so comment those out in ABC_wrap.c)
5) Place the core library .so file in the appropriate jniLibs/XXX directory
6) use the obj version of the ndk-build, not the libs version, of libairbitz.so, placed next to the core.so library.
7) remove the libs and obj directories so Studio isn't confused which libairbitz.so to use

Here's a working swig command issued from the main airbitz directory: swig -java -package com.airbitz.api -outdir src/main/java/com/airbitz/api -o src/main/jni/ABC_wrap.c src/main/jni/ABC.i

See NavigationActivity for how to initialize the core library.
