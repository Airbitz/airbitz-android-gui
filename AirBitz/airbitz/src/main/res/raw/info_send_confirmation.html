    Enter the value to Send in either the Bitcoin or fiat (ie. USD/EUR)
    currency fields. The alternate currency value will be automatically calculated
    based on the current exchange rate.<br><br>

    Hit [Max] to send the maximum amount of money from your currently selected
    wallet. Note that the maximum amount may be less than the current balance due
    to transaction fees or prior unconfirmed transactions.<br><br>

    Enter your withdrawal PIN and slide the button to the left to send your
    transaction.<br><br>

    Note that the full balance of your wallet may not be available for
    withdrawal as prior transactions need to confirm before funds associated with
    them can be spent. Each transaction also requires a small transaction fee which
    reduces the total that can be sent from the wallet.<br><br>
