Here is the manual procedure to build the jni files from AirBitz c core .so file:

* Obtain the core library .so file and the ABC.h file
* build the bridge JNI using swig in a terminal - see the example command. It also creates many classes in the api directory.
* Perform ndk-build in a terminal at the jni directory
* Place the core library libabc.so file in the appropriate jniLibs/XXX directory
* use the obj directory of the ndk-build, not the libs directory, of libairbitz.so, and place next to the libabc.so library in jniLibs folder.
* remove the libs and obj directories so Studio isn't confused which libairbitz.so to use

Example swig command issued from the main airbitz directory: swig -java -package com.airbitz.api -outdir src/main/java/com/airbitz/api -o src/main/jni/ABC_wrap.c src/main/jni/ABC.i
